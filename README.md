## How the AI Magic Works

When your child creates a dream, the app:
1. Takes their selections (animals, location, activities)
2. Creates a child-friendly story description
3. Sends this to DALL-E 3 with the prompt: "Create a cartoon representation of the following dream of a 3 year old girl using the following description: [dream description]"
4. Displays the beautiful AI-generated image alongside the story
5. Shows a loading animation while the magic happens!

## Technologies Used
